 Project Change Log: kniche
===========================

2005-02-25  schwilkd  <try@schwilk.org>

	* README: Added information on optomized builds.

	* src/TEnvironment.h: Edited comments for typos.

	* src/TRun.cpp:
	Fixed run output header (replaced 'cycles' with 'epochs').

2005-02-24  schwilkd  <try@schwilk.org>

	* configure.in: Added --enable-debug option.

2005-02-23  schwilkd  <try@schwilk.org>

	* src/main.cpp:
	Added checks for system getopt.h to use that if available rather than
	DWS::getopt.

2005-02-22  schwilkd  <try@schwilk.org>

	* src/TLandscape.cpp, src/TLandscape.h:
	Added Repopulate() method to re-assign species to locations using the existing
	mc.

	* src/main.cpp:
	Fixed problem with -m monotonic option.  Environment was not being re-ordered
	because TRun.Initialize() was called after aming the environment monotonic.

2005-02-17  schwilkd   <try@schwilk.org>
	
	* src/TSpeciesPool.cpp: Added comment headers and description.

	* src/dws/dws_stlstats.h:
	Added 'typename' to template average functions.  Not sure why this is
	necessary, but g++ 3.4 balked.

	* src/dws/dws_math.h: Fixed deleted char.

2005-02-16  schwilkd  <try@schwilk.org>

	* src/mainpage.h: Updated abstract.

2005-02-15  schwilkd  <try@schwilk.org>

	* src/TRun.h: Added GetLandscape function.

	* src/main.cpp:
	Changed -m implementation to use new TLandscape::MakeEnvMonotonic.

	* src/TEnvGenerator.h, src/TEnvGenerator.cpp:
	Removed MakeMonotonic method.  This ability was instead added to TEnvironment.

	* src/TLandscape.h, src/TLandscape.cpp:
	Added MakeEnvMonotonic method.  Eventually the TEnvironment class can
	probably be removed and I can have TLandscape manage the environmental
	array directly.

	* src/TEnvironment.cpp, src/TEnvironment.h: Added MakeMonotonic method.

2005-02-14  schwilkd  <try@schwilk.org>

	* src/main.cpp: Made -m option work so that we can do paired testing.

	* src/TRun.h, src/TRun.cpp:
	Removed stability testing, changed i/o format slightly (removed
	_cycles, added _epochs).

	* src/TEnvGenerator.h, src/TEnvGenerator.cpp: Added GaussianGenerator.

	* src/TEnvGenerator.cpp:
	Added z-score normalization to fractal generator.

2005-02-11  schwilkd  <try@schwilk.org>

	* src/TRun.h:
	Refactored: moved run initialization code into separate function from
	Run().

	* src/main.cpp: Implemented -m option.

	* src/TRun.cpp:
	Refactored: moved run initialization code into separate function from
	Run().

	* src/TLandscape.h, src/TLandscape.cpp, src/TEnvironment.cpp: 
	Cleaned comments, added GNU header.

	* src/TEnvGenerator.h: Added MakeMonotonic() method.

2005-02-10  schwilkd  <try@schwilk.org>

	* src/main.cpp: Added -m (monotonic) option.  But no implmentation yet.

	* src/TEnvGenerator.h: Fixed typo in TFractalGenerator declaration.

	* src/TOption.cpp, src/TOption.h: Added GNU comment header.

	* src/TEnvGenerator.h:
	Added description to TFractalGenerator constructor.

2005-01-26  schwilkd  <try@schwilk.org>

	* src/dws/dws_fractal.h: Edited comments.

	* src/dws/dws_random.h:
	Added Doxygen comments. Renamed functions to use lower_case naming
	style to match all my other libraries.

	* src/dws/dws_math.h:
	modified code to meet ansi standards and compile on mingw, cygwin,
	linux. Added Doxygen comments and removed non-templated math functions
	to dws_numerical library (dws_numerical.h and dws_numerical.cpp).  The
	dws_math library now consists only of the template header file
	dws_math.h.  I also un-capitalized the utility functions (abs, etc) to
	conform with my coding standards.

	* src/dws/dws_getopt.cpp:
	eliminated MFC dependencies.  I use it with mingw.

	* src/dws/dws_numerical.cpp: Added GNU comment header.

	* src/dws/dws_numerical.cpp:
	I made some minor changes to remove dependency on dws_math template
	library.  Now dws_math and dws_numerical are independent.


============================================================================
 Old ChangeLog (prior to RCS):
	
 Ver   Date       Action
----- ------      -----------------------------------------------
4.5   040706      Changed immigration rate usage (now once per 	    
                    recruitment event).  Changed population history output
	            (-p option) to use more succinct format to save space
	            and time. Store all normal probability calls in a
	            lookup table to sppedup simulation.  This makes a huge
	            difference!
		                                                            
		                                                            
4.4   040701      Removed fitness threshold . Wasn't being used	    
                    so I tried to speed up the code.			    
                    <TLandscape.cpp, TLandscape.h, TRun.cpp, TRun.h	    
                    TRun.h, main.cpp>					    
		                                                            
4.0   030531      Eliminated dependency on boost library, split	    
                    TEnvironment into a second class, TEnvGenerator,	    
                    which produces the environmental function.		    
                    TEnvironment is now a component of TLandscape	    
                    and is a simple array.  TLandscapes can now be	    
                    read to and from files.  Serialization is		    
                    through operator>> and <<.  The Format()		    
                    function now outputs to a stream for easy		    
                    human-readable/spreadsheet pastable			    
                    representation. <TLandscape.h, TLandscape.cpp,	    
                    TEnvGenerator.cpp, TEnvGenerator.h>			    
		                                                            
3.0   030421      Speeded up recruitment by eliminating ability	    
                    of simulation to use alternative parent selection and   
                    competition algorithms.				    
		                                                            
2.3.1   030716      Added -s command line option.  Now random number	    
                    seed can be set which should allow easier		    
                    batch-spawning of kniche without problems of	    
                    each instance starting with same 'random'		    
                    sequence due to the clock. <main.cpp>		    
		                                                            
2.3.0   030415      Added population statistics -- distribution stats,	    
                    overlap stats To TLandscape.			    
		                                                            
1.2.0   021109      Improved command line options			    
                    Reads input runs now (cin or file).
