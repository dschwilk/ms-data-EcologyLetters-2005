KNICHE

A model for exploring community assembly on environmental gradients

Dylan W. Schwilk, 2003, 2004, 2005

kniche is written in c++ and is known to compile correctly with gcc on
windows (using the mingw port of gcc) and on Mandrake Linux 9.2 - 10.1.
It should work on most unix flavors.

To build kniche, go to the top level directory, run "./configure";
then "make all".  The kniche executable will be in the kniche
subdirectory.  for command line options run "kniche -h".  For an
example run, go to example subdirectory and type

"../kniche/kniche < example.txt"

For generic information on the configure build script see the file
INSTALL.  The supplied configure script accepts the --enable-debug
option which by default is set to 'yes'.  To build a fast optimezed
version of kniche you may want to do something like:

CFLAGS="-march=athlon-xp" ./configure --enable-debug=no

Which is how I build kniche on my athlon box.
