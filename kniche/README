KNICHE

A model for exploring community assembly on environmental gradients

Dylan W. Schwilk, 2003, 2004, 2005

kniche is written in c++ and is known to compile correctly with gcc on windows
(using the mingw port of gcc) and it should work on most unix flavors.

To build kniche, go to the top level directory (kniche), run "./configure";
then "make all". The kniche executable will be in the src subdirectory. for
command line options run "kniche -h". For an example run, go to src
subdirectory and type

"./kniche < example.txt"

For generic information on the configure build script see the file INSTALL. The
supplied configure script accepts the --enable-debug option which by default is
set to 'yes'.
