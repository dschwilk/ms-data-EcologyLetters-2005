  The kniche simulation investigates community dynamics in a spatially

\section Abstract
 
Community structure and functional diversity along climatic gradients: a
spatially explicit model

Dylan W. Schwilk and David D. Ackerly

Recent developments in community models emphasize the importance of
incorporating stochastic  processes (e.g., ecological drift) in models of
niche-structured community assembly. We constructed a finite, spatially
explicit, lottery model to simulate the distribution of species in a
one-dimensional landscape with an underlying gradient in environmental
conditions.  Our framework combines the potential for ecological drift
with environmentally-mediated competition for space in a heterogeneous
environment.  We examined the influence of niche breadth, dispersal
distances, community size (total number of individuals) and the breadth of
the environmental gradient on levels of species and functional trait
diversity (i.e. differences in niche optima). Three novel results emerge
from this model: 1) niche differences between adjacent species (e.g.,
limiting similarity) increase in smaller communities, due to the
interaction of competitive effects and finite population sizes, 2)
immigration from a regional species pool, stochasticity and niche-assembly
generate a bimodal distribution of species residence times (`transient'
and `resident') under a heterogeneous environment, and 3) the magnitude of
environmental heterogeneity has a U-shaped effect on diversity, due to
shifts in species richness of resident vs. transient species. These
predictions illustrate the potential importance of stochastic (though not
necessarily neutral) processes in community assembly.
